TemporaNR = The modified XITS font with addition of TironianEt (U+204A) was combinated with IFAO-Grec Unicode of Jean-Luc Fournet and Ralph Hancock; the combination, correcting the kerning, modifying part of oldstyle figures and somes philological glyphs, and adding minuscules capitals for bold and coursive, produces "TemporaNR", a Times-like font for textual criticism for using in LaTeX and text processors.

This font is a derivative work based on:
- XITS (SIL Open Font License),
- IFAO-Grec Unicode by Jean-Luc Fournet and Ralph Hancock with help of Adam BÃ¼low-Jacobsen (available without rights).
